# Refills ⛽

Track your fuel usage effortlessly — no sign-ups, no cloud sync, just simple and private record keeping.

**Refills** is a lightweight fuel tracking app built with **Flutter**, designed to store all your data **locally** using **SharedPreferences** and **SQLite**. Whether you're monitoring costs, fuel efficiency, or just want to nerd out over your car stats, Refills has your back.

> ⚠️ This is a **vibe-coded**, **100% AI-generated** app — born from a string of spontaneous prompts, coffee-fueled dev sessions, and a "ship it now, fix it later" mentality.  
> The code may be messy, but the vibes? Immaculate. PRs welcome 😎
